Design a mobile-first happy birthday website with a dark blue theme. The overall feel should be romantic but minimalist, using smooth, subtle animations (nothing flashy).

The main heading should say:
“Happy 24th Birthday, Jeannine — baby, mahal, my love.”

Below the header, display 24 short birthday messages in a vertical scrolling layout. As the user scrolls, each message should snap into focus, highlight, and briefly lock the scroll before allowing the next one—so each message feels intentional and special.

Use these messages in order:
